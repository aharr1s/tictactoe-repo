This program is a final term project for my discrete structures course. It is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game., and it works well to demonstrate the principles of discrete structures. Within the game, there are only EIGHT (three rows, three columns, and 2 diagonals) winning combinations possible. In discrete structures, these would be written as:
 P11 ∧ P12 ∧ P13, top row win
 P21 ∧ P22 ∧ P23, middle row win
 P31 ∧ P32 ∧ P33, bottom row win

 P11 ∧ P21 ∧ P31, top column win
 P21 ∧ P22 ∧ P32, middle column win
 P31 ∧ P23 ∧ P33, bottom column win

 P11 ∧ P22 ∧ P33, top-left to bottom-right diagonal win
 P23 ∧ P22 ∧ P31, top-right to bottom-left diagonal win
In these propositions, Pij is meant to represent the cell i in row j of the grid that gets marked by the player. ∧ represents the logical AND operator, ensuring that all the cells that macth the winning condition are marked by the same player. These propositions define the winning conditions in the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
